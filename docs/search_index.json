[["index.html", "R for Humanities 1 Welcome!", " R for Humanities RDM Support &amp; Digital Humanities Lab, Utrecht University Library 2021-10-28 1 Welcome! R is a powerful scripting language for data handling, data visualization, and statistics. In this workshop, we aim to give you the tools to start exploring R and all it has to offer by yourself. We will take you from the very basics in R syntax, to data handling and visualisation using a set of tools known as the tidyverse. You will learn how to perform text mining using the tidytext package, enabling you to handle your own data in a clean, robust, and reproducible manner. We will work in RStudio and introduce R as well as R Markdown: this is a great way to combine code and its output with text, allowing you to code in a narrative and intuitive way. Moreover, this way you produce a human-readable document with which you can easily share and showcase your work. This workshop specifically targets researchers working within the Humanities, focusing on the analysis of textual data (as found in poems and novels, for example). However, it is open to and useful for all UU employees who want to perform computational textual analyses.

Also, R packages bundled in the tidyverse are used. This document shows how to install R and RStudio, and how to install and load tidyverse from Rstudio. Most workshops on R programming make use of an RStudio server. With an RStudio server, the participant logs in onto the website and gets a web based RStudio IDE. We prefer a local installation of RStudio for our workshop. We hope that this removes a barrier for users to start working with R themselves. Because not every system is equally cooperative in installing everything, we have compiled an elaborate. Please let us know of any errors that you encountered, and how you fixed them! We will add these to the guide. "],["installation.html", "4.1 Installation", " 4.1 Installation 4.1.1 Install R and RStudio on a personal laptop. I.e. a laptop with administrator rights. Install R from https://cran.rstudio.com/ Install Rstudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download 4.1.2 Install R and RStudio on a Utrecht University laptop. Open Software Center Install R for Windows Installing R packages on a Utrecht University laptop can be hard. This is because R packages are installed on a so-called mounted drive. This causes problems with the performance. Check the installation as follows: Open RStudio Write the following line of code in your console: .libPaths(), and press enter to execute. If the response starts with // or \\\\, you are installing on a mounted drive. Follow the steps on the next page to change the installation location. 4.1.3 Install Tidyverse from Rstudio From the console: 1. Open Rstudio. 2. Look for a window that says console (probably bottom left of your screen). 3. In the console, type: install.packages(\"tidyverse\") 4. hit enter. You can also install using the RStudio GUI: 1. Open Rstudio. 2. At the window on the bottom right of your screen, select the tab packages. 3. Click install and type tidyverse in the box. 4. Make sure the checkbox marked install dependencies is checked, and click install. The tidyverse installation might take a while, just let it run. If it asks you something, say yes, unless it looks particularly outlandish. If you want to check your tidyverse installation, find the console window, and type: library(tidyverse). Then hit enter. You should see something that looks like this:  Attaching packages tidyverse 1.2.1   ggplot2 2.2.1  purrr 0.2.5  tibble 1.4.2  dplyr 0.7.4  tidyr 0.8.1  stringr 1.2.0  readr 1.1.1  forcats 0.3.0  Conflicts tidyverse_conflicts()   dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()  dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() "],["troubleshooting.html", "4.2 Troubleshooting", " 4.2 Troubleshooting 4.2.1 Packages are being installed on a mounted drive This can cause various errors, and even if everything goes right, installing tidyverse takes ages. Solution 1: There is a solution to prevent problems with mounted drives for applications like R, RStudio and Office. Read more about the solution on intranet. https://intranet.uu.nl/en/current-affairs/announcements/would-you-make-your-solis-laptop-work-more-efficiently Solution 2: Create a folder R-packages on a local drive. Copy the location to that drive. For example: C:/Users/User/R-packages. Run the following line of code: file.edit(file.path(\"~\", \".Rprofile\")) Paste .libPaths(\"C:/Users/User/R-packages\") in the editor and save the file. Restart your R session Click on Packages&gt;Install. Is Install to library pointing to C:/Users/User/R-packages? If not: check if the path is correctly spelled. Try inverting the slashes (\\ instead of /). You may need to use double slashes (\\\\ or //). Tick source on save, click save, and check Packages&gt;Install again. 4.2.2 Tidyverse installation is aborted If the installation of tidyverse is aborted, and packages are downloaded but their installation is said to have non zero exit status, you may be dealing with an old version of R. Update R by installing a recent version from CRAN. Then try installing tidyverse again. Do you have Rtools installed? (Only on Windows; it is not clear why this works but it sometimes does.) Install this via cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. 4.2.3 Unable to move temporary installation (Windows error) Do you get issues like this: &gt; install.packages(&quot;tibble&quot;) Installing package into C:/Users/UserName/R (as lib is unspecified) trying URL &#39;https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/contrib/3.4/tibble_1.4.2.zip&#39; Content type &#39;application/zip&#39; length 172649 bytes (168 KB) downloaded 168 KB package tibble successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked Warning in install.packages : unable to move temporary installation C:\\Users\\UserName\\R\\file18b813387562\\tibble to C:\\Users\\UserName\\R\\tibble The downloaded binary packages are in C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpYh5ogU\\downloaded_packages Check for the line unable to move temporary installation. Your virus scanner might be blocking the installation of tidyverse. The solution (found here) is to enter: trace(utils:::unpackPkgZip, edit=TRUE) You should see: Tracing function &quot;unpackPkgZip&quot; in package &quot;utils (not-exported)&quot; [1] &quot;unpackPkgZip&quot; And a file should open. Change 0.5 in line 142 to 2.5, save the file, and try installing tidyverse again. 4.2.4 Library(tidyverse) loading failed Dependencies might be missing, or outdated, and need to be installed/updated manually. For instance, you see the following error: Error: package or namespace load failed for &#39;tidyverse&#39;in loadNamespace(...) namespace &#39;bindrcpp&#39; 0.2 is being loaded, but &gt;= 0.2.0.9000 is required. Run install.packages(\"bindrcpp\")to update this package. Error: package or namespace load failed for &#39;tidyverse&#39;in loadNamespace(...) there is no package called (xxx) The same solution as above applies: run install.packages() to add whatever package is missing. (At the time of writing, it is not clear why these packages are missing; this error was received over email.)
