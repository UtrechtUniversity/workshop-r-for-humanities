[["index.html", "R for Humanities 1 Welcome!", " R for Humanities RDM Support &amp; Digital Humanities Lab, Utrecht University Library 2021-06-29 1 Welcome! R is a powerful scripting language for data handling, data visualization, and statistics. In this workshop, we aim to give you the tools to start exploring R and all it has to offer by yourself. We will take you from the very basics in R syntax, to data handling and visualisation using a set of tools known as the tidyverse. You will learn how to perform text mining using the tidytext package, enabling you to handle your own data in a clean, robust, and reproducible manner. We will work in RStudio and introduce R as well as R Markdown: this is a great way to combine code and its output with text, allowing you to code in a narrative and intuitive way. Moreover, this way you produce a human-readable document with which you can easily share and showcase your work. This workshop specifically targets researchers working within the Humanities, focusing on the analysis of textual data (as found in poems and novels, for example). However, it is open to and useful for all UU employees who want to perform computational textual analyses.
